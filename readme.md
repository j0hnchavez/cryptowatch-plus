### Crypto tracker & trade tester

These scripts track the price of a cryptocurrency and backtest a simple investment strategy on them. They build on [Cryptowatch](https://github.com/alexanderepstein/cryptowatch).

This was my final project in OMIS 106 (Systems Programming) in June 2019. The scripts are run via simple CLIs and require a working version of Cryptowatch.
